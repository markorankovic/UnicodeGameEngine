# UnicodeGameEngine

Written by Marko Rankovic


The unicode game engine is like any other 2D game engine, only the graphics in this game engine is built up of unicode characters instead of directly being represented by pixels. For instance, in a normal game engine you would see a man with most if not all the physical features of a man. In this game engine on the other hand, a man would be commonly represented in a much more simplistic fashion (See Example 1 below) as text characters are limited, and also bigger as they usually are represented by more than one pixel.


This game engine comes in two forms. The first being "FLOAT", which is a game that I am working towards by developing the game engine itself to suit the game's needs. The second being "SDU Paint", which is a painting program for painting unicode characters over a canvas for creating sprites. Both instances should work simply by importing into a Java Runtime Environment.




Examples of graphics in the engine:
